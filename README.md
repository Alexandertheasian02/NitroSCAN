# NitroSCAN

Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a mobile application designed to assist rice farmers in optimizing nitrogen fertilizer application. The NitroSCAN application allows users to capture images of rice leaves using a standard external camera, generating Leaf Color Chart (LCC) values. Based on these LCC values, the system calculates the required amount of nitrogen fertilizer and provides real-time recommendations to the user through the mobile app.

Features

Image capture functionality for rice leaves.
LCC value generation from captured images.
Real-time calculation of required nitrogen fertilizer.
User-friendly interface for easy navigation.
